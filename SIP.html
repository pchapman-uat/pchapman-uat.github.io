Henceforth around 711 million people would be viable to use this mobile app.</p></section><section id="projectDescription"><h3>Project Description</h3><p>This is a mobile app for the existing software Foobar2000, that will allow you to control your desktop music player, remotely using your phone, tablet, or other smart device. The goal is to provide a great user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), while still maintaining the abundant number of features that foobar2000 offers. The features would include Playlist, Library, Playback Queue, Album Art, Local Library, Lightweight, Customizable, and more. Although foobar2000 is a great freeware application, it is on the older side, but it still has updates to this date, it is also highly customizable with skins and plugins. The goal is to use an open-sourced plugin called “Beefweb” which allows for communication over HTTP to control Foobar2000 remotely. I will not be creating the music player (Foobar2000) or the API (Beefweb), I will be creating a mobile app that uses Beefweb to control Foobar, while having an easy-to-use UI.</p></section><section id="innovationClaim"><h3>Innovation Claim</h3><p>When listening to music locally, with either a server or just your computer, it can be difficult to control the playback remotely without the need for a complicated setup.</p></section><section id="securityReport"><h3>Security Report</h3><p>Bellow is a security report of the application as of release "0.2.0-alpha-1"</p><img class="_fullImg_m7djq_14" src="/assets/mobSF-0.2.0-alpha.1-B52HQnmm.png"><div class="_pdfContainer_m7djq_3"><iframe src="/assets/MobSF-0.2.0-alpha.1-rcG-MBvE.pdf"></iframe></div><p>Report generated by<a href="https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF" target="_blank">MobSF</a></p></section><section><div class="_pdfContainer_m7djq_3"><iframe src="/assets/SIP311-Project_Proposal-PChapman-(Version_2)-C7INTMSA.pdf"></iframe></div></section></div></main><footer><p><a href="https://github.com/pchapman-uat/pchapman-uat.github.io">Source</a>Preston Chapman © 2025.<a href="https://github.com/pchapman-uat/pchapman-uat.github.io/blob/main/LICENSE">Apache 2.0 License</a></p></footer></div><script>window.__staticRouterHydrationData = JSON.parse("{\"loaderData\":{\"0\":null,\"0-2\":null},\"actionData\":null,\"errors\":null}");</script></div>
