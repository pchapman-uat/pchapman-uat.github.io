The features would include Playlist, Library, Playback Queue, Album Art, Local Library, Lightweight, Customizable, and more. Although foobar2000 is a great freeware application, it is on the older side, but it still has updates to this date, it is also highly customizable with skins and plugins. The goal is to use an open-sourced plugin called “Beefweb” which allows for communication over HTTP to control Foobar2000 remotely.
